# Machine Learning Model Optimization and Visualization

## Overview

This project provides a Python-based solution for visualizing datasets and optimizing machine learning models. It focuses on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree classifiers, enabling users to find the best hyperparameters and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps, histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Fine-tuning `k` for KNN.
  - Adjusting `max_depth` for Decision Trees.

- **Prediction**: Evaluate the performance of optimized models.
